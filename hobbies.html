          <h2>Coding</h2>
          
          <p>I started learning code last year using the free website CodeAcademy. This was my first introduction to the world of web development.</p>
          <p>As I practiced programming more and more, I grew to liking it more and more since I want to learn a new skill and I enjoy the challenge.</p>
          <p>Even though I was employed in a full-time job, I've decided to make a career change and spent my free time practicing my skills as well as gaining new ones by practicing on free courses and reading programmimg books.</p>

          <h2>Play Guitar</h2>
          
          <p>I've been playing guitar since the age of 10.</p>
          <p>Playing music brings out my creative juices, and is a great way for me to express myself and is a form of self-therapy .</p>
          <p>Whether I play in a party or with my band, I feel the most alive (along with programmimg, haha!) playing music. </p>
